# ArcGISProjects
This repository includes beginner ArcGIS projects that I created to test what I learned from ESRI training. 

"UNCC Dorms and Food" shows how access to food changes depending on which dorm an on-campus student may reside in at UNC Charlotte. The color gradient shows distance to a food hall (green representing close, red representing far), transparency shows the capacity of the given dorm (transparent representing an empty dorm), and the outline represents whether the dorm rooms feature kitchens, as shown in the legend. 

"Silver Bus" investigates the Silver Route on UNC Charlotte's campus and the different travel times and stop times. The project uses color to show both the average stop time at each stop and the average travel time between stops. I collected the data for a previous project, found at https://github.com/darrentsumm/UNCC-Bus-ETA. < \br>
Future improvements include adding a legend, different routes, and creating a time map, which would change based on time and day of the week.
